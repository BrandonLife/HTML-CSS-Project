                Hello, My name is Brandon. I have worked in the security industry for over a decade and now am looking
                for the next step in my life. I have always had a love
                for computers. I find computers to be almost therapeutic. It began as a child when i received my first
                computer. I would use computers to play games and solve crimes within the games. My awakening began
                here.
                Now as a seasoned vet within the security industry, i am looking to add more skills to my already
                extensive
                skillset. You can never have too many skills. Villans are more cunning than ever and i need to be one
                step ahead. If you hire me,
                not only will you be getting the best of the best but more. Competition will fear you, they will beg
                you, and they will know what
                it means to be the best. On Saturdays, I run with a group of extraordinary people that like to make
                great changes around the globe.
                So you can even add community service to my skillset.
            </p>
